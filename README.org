* Noematon

a C-based simulation engine that merges agent-based dynamics, semiotic processes, and image-guided pattern writing on a shared canvas.
It is not just a graphics program—it is an experiment in how symbols, rituals, and names emerge in a distributed system.
** Features

***  Two-phase process:

**** Simulation phase – agents evolve through symbolic interactions (naming, ritualized coordination, action-binding).
**** Pattern writing phase – agents converge toward a target image (IMG1.jpeg), embedding semiotic traces into visual form.
*** Semiotic engine
****  Agents can invent and share names (up to 254).

**** Names are linked to actions (movement, drawing, transformations).

**** Rituals emerge when names/actions repeat successfully; once thresholds are crossed, rituals become stable semiotic anchors.

**** Failure or misuse erodes symbolic stability.
*** Embodied sense-making
**** signs are not static, but enacted through repetition, feedback, and collective alignment.
